# DSA
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python are essential for writing efficient code. Python offers built-in data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, along with algorithms for searching, sorting, and recursion. Mastering DSA helps solve complex problems with optimal time and space usage.
